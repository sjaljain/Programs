/*
 * Crossing Streets
  Peter Longfoot is a student at the university of Suburbia. Every morning, Peter leaves home to walk to the university. Many other students are driving their cars or riding their bicycles to campus, but Peter prefers to walk, avoiding the chaotic traffic of the city as much as possible.


 Unfortunately, Peter cannot avoid the traffic entirely, since he has to cross streets in order to reach the university. Recently, Peter has wondered how to minimize the number of streets he has to cross. For example, in the following map, streets are drawn as horizontal and vertical lines. To reach the university starting at his home, Peter has to cross at least two streets. Peter cannot cross a street pair at an intersection and Peter cannot walk along a street.
